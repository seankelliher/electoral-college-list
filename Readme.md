# Electoral College

Interactive Electoral College calculator. User adds/subtracts states to find combinations that get the 270 votes needed to win the US Presidental Election. Highlighting shows (1) which states have been selected and (2) who won each state in the 2016 Presidental Election. A "real time" total is maintained. No need to press a "submit" button. Also, the "total" number of votes is fixed. No need to scroll up/down on small screens to see it.
